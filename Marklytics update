## ⚙️ How It Works

- Users login through the `LoginForm` which verifies their role and credentials.
- Role-based access:
  - Students can only view their marks.
  - Teachers can update marks only for students in their assigned section.
- Marks are inserted through a stored procedure that auto-calculates `CIE`, `SEE_50`, `Total`, and `Grade`.
- Every login is logged using a SQL trigger that monitors `LoginFlag`.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Java Swing GUI
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- SQL Joins & Constraints
- Stored Procedures & Triggers
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Data Validation & Exception Handling

---

## 🧪 SQL Components

- `schema.sql`: Creates tables (Users, Students, Teachers, Marks, Grades, etc.)
- `procedures.sql`: Stored procedures for inserting students, teachers, and calculating marks
- `triggers.sql`: Trigger to log login events to `LoginActivity`
- `tables.sql`: Insert default values into Departments, Sections, Grades
